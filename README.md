# LAURA - FULL-STACK UI CHALLENGE

## Introduction

Welcome to LAURA's Full-Stack UI Challenge.

The primary goal of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to write well-defined HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the latest patterns and technologies in a mobile-first approach. There's no hard rules or tricky questions.

**We hope you have fun.**

If you are not a developer, you can have a look at our other opportunities at [laura-br.gupy.io](https://laura-br.gupy.io/)

## About Us

Laura is a Cognitive Robot Risk Manager that operates integrated with data environments to collect, organize and ultimately perform complex calculations, compare results with probabilistic ranges and accurately conclude whether or not conditions are favourable for a risk event occurs.

## About The Challenge

You will have 5 days to deliver this challenge, but be aware that we will more rigorously evaluate your code the longer it takes to deliver from the date this repository was forked.

For this exercise, you need to build a fast, responsive, mobile-first dashboard page. You will have to develop 2 screens (dashboard screen and login/signup screen) with fake data, following the layout below:

Also, you need to build a REST API that allows the users to sign up and authenticate using a JWT token. The data must be persisted into one of the following databases: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

## Screens

The screen provided is the expected final design. However, you are expected to implement a user interface on the login/sign up screen and the responsiveness by yourself.

## Technology

Since the purpose of this exercise is to assess your HTML, CSS and JavaScript abilities, we discourage the use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material UI but encourage the use of React or any other frontend framework.

## Bonus Points

- Documentation in code
- API documentation (e.g. Swagger)
- Small files with few responsibilities
- Use some preprocessor for your CSS, preferably SASS
- Get data from an API Generator (e.g. [JSON Generator](https://www.json-generator.com/))
- Follow some Javascript Style Guide
- Save user information in Local Storage
- Componentization
- Unit/Component Test
- Usage of Docker

## Review

After you delivered the completed assignment to us, we will review it as soon as we can. **We pay special attention to:**

- Coding skills

- - Writing understandable code
  - Whether you use HTML, JavaScript and CSS properly

- Software Engineering Skills

- - Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)

- Overall Feeling

- - Software usability
  - Assignment completion
  - Overall code quality (edge cases, usage of tools, performance, best practices)
